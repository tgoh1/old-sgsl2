        <p><b>In an online video, Amanda opined her thoughts on sign language and her hopes for the club. Click here for the online video.</b></p><br>
        <p>Zaobao featured SP’s Diploma in Nutrition, Health and Wellness graduate, Amanda Chia, who formed the SP Sign Language Club to share her sign language knowledge and raise awareness towards the hearing impaired. When Amanda was still a SP student, she raised the suggestion of forming the Sign Language Club on SP’s Facebook page. This idea was well-received by her hearing impaired classmantes and the SP Sign Language Club slowly expanded from around ten members at the start to 100 over members currently. Even though she has graduated, Amanda mentioned that she would like to support the activities by the club and hopes to continue using her sign language skills for the benefit of the society.</p>
