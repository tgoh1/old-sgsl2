      There is no officially recognized national sign language in Singapore. Since Singapore's independence in 1965, the Singapore deaf community has had to adapt to many linguistic changes. Today, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture. SgSL is influenced by Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL), American Sign Language (ASL), Signing Exact English (SEE-II) and locally developed signs. The total number of deaf clients registered with The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf), an organisation that advocates equal opportunity in all aspects for the deaf and supports the deaf, is 5756 as of 2014. In Singapore, it is known that 1 in 1000 has hearing loss.

    <p><b>Language and sign systems used in Singapore</b></p><br>
    <p>While Singapore does not have a national sign language, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as Singaporeâ€™s native sign language. This is because sign language in Singapore has developed over the last 6 decades since the setting up of the first school for local deaf in 1954. Hence, there is crucial need to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s.</p>
